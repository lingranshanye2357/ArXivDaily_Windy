#### Transfer Learning-Based Deep Residual Learning for Speech Recognition in Clean and Noisy Environments
 - **Authors:** Noussaiba Djeffal, Djamel Addou, Hamza Kheddar, Sid Ahmed Selouani
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
Audio and Speech Processing (eess.AS); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Sound (cs.SD)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01632

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.01632

 - **Abstract**
 Addressing the detrimental impact of non-stationary environmental noise on automatic speech recognition (ASR) has been a persistent and significant research focus. Despite advancements, this challenge continues to be a major concern. Recently, data-driven supervised approaches, such as deep neural networks, have emerged as promising alternatives to traditional unsupervised methods. With extensive training, these approaches have the potential to overcome the challenges posed by diverse real-life acoustic environments. In this light, this paper introduces a novel neural framework that incorporates a robust frontend into ASR systems in both clean and noisy environments. Utilizing the Aurora-2 speech database, the authors evaluate the effectiveness of an acoustic feature set for Mel-frequency, employing the approach of transfer learning based on Residual neural network (ResNet). The experimental results demonstrate a significant improvement in recognition accuracy compared to convolutional neural networks (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. They achieved accuracies of 98.94% in clean and 91.21% in noisy mode.
#### FLOWER: Flow-Based Estimated Gaussian Guidance for General Speech Restoration
 - **Authors:** Da-Hee Yang, Jaeuk Lee, Joon-Hyuk Chang
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
Audio and Speech Processing (eess.AS); Sound (cs.SD)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01750

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.01750

 - **Abstract**
 We introduce FLOWER, a novel conditioning method designed for speech restoration that integrates Gaussian guidance into generative frameworks. By transforming clean speech into a predefined prior distribution (e.g., Gaussian distribution) using a normalizing flow network, FLOWER extracts critical information to guide generative models. This guidance is incorporated into each block of the generative network, enabling precise restoration control. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of FLOWER in improving performance across various general speech restoration tasks.
#### MaskClip: Detachable Clip-on Piezoelectric Sensing of Mask Surface Vibrations for Real-time Noise-Robust Speech Input
 - **Authors:** Hirotaka Hiraki, Jun Rekimoto
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
Sound (cs.SD); Hardware Architecture (cs.AR); Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC); Audio and Speech Processing (eess.AS)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02180

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.02180

 - **Abstract**
 Masks are essential in medical settings and during infectious outbreaks but significantly impair speech communication, especially in environments with background noise. Existing solutions often require substantial computational resources or compromise hygiene and comfort. We propose a novel sensing approach that captures only the wearer's voice by detecting mask surface vibrations using a piezoelectric sensor. Our developed device, MaskClip, employs a stainless steel clip with an optimally positioned piezoelectric sensor to selectively capture speech vibrations while inherently filtering out ambient noise. Evaluation experiments demonstrated superior performance with a low Character Error Rate of 6.1\% in noisy environments compared to conventional microphones. Subjective evaluations by 102 participants also showed high satisfaction scores. This approach shows promise for applications in settings where clear voice communication must be maintained while wearing protective equipment, such as medical facilities, cleanrooms, and industrial environments.
#### Bemba Speech Translation: Exploring a Low-Resource African Language
 - **Authors:** Muhammad Hazim Al Farouq, Aman Kassahun Wassie, Yasmin Moslem
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
Computation and Language (cs.CL); Sound (cs.SD); Audio and Speech Processing (eess.AS)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02518

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.02518

 - **Abstract**
 This paper describes our system submission to the International Conference on Spoken Language Translation (IWSLT 2025), low-resource languages track, namely for Bemba-to-English speech translation. We built cascaded speech translation systems based on Whisper and NLLB-200, and employed data augmentation techniques, such as back-translation. We investigate the effect of using synthetic data and discuss our experimental setup.
#### Automatic Proficiency Assessment in L2 English Learners
 - **Authors:** Armita Mohammadi, Alessandro Lameiras Koerich, Laureano Moro-Velazquez, Patrick Cardinal
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
Computation and Language (cs.CL); Sound (cs.SD); Audio and Speech Processing (eess.AS)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02615

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.02615

 - **Abstract**
 Second language proficiency (L2) in English is usually perceptually evaluated by English teachers or expert evaluators, with the inherent intra- and inter-rater variability. This paper explores deep learning techniques for comprehensive L2 proficiency assessment, addressing both the speech signal and its correspondent transcription. We analyze spoken proficiency classification prediction using diverse architectures, including 2D CNN, frequency-based CNN, ResNet, and a pretrained wav2vec 2.0 model. Additionally, we examine text-based proficiency assessment by fine-tuning a BERT language model within resource constraints. Finally, we tackle the complex task of spontaneous dialogue assessment, managing long-form audio and speaker interactions through separate applications of wav2vec 2.0 and BERT models. Results from experiments on EFCamDat and ANGLISH datasets and a private dataset highlight the potential of deep learning, especially the pretrained wav2vec 2.0 model, for robust automated L2 proficiency evaluation.
#### LLaMA-Omni2: LLM-based Real-time Spoken Chatbot with Autoregressive Streaming Speech Synthesis
 - **Authors:** Qingkai Fang, Yan Zhou, Shoutao Guo, Shaolei Zhang, Yang Feng
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
Computation and Language (cs.CL); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Sound (cs.SD); Audio and Speech Processing (eess.AS)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02625

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.02625

 - **Abstract**
 Real-time, intelligent, and natural speech interaction is an essential part of the next-generation human-computer interaction. Recent advancements have showcased the potential of building intelligent spoken chatbots based on large language models (LLMs). In this paper, we introduce LLaMA-Omni 2, a series of speech language models (SpeechLMs) ranging from 0.5B to 14B parameters, capable of achieving high-quality real-time speech interaction. LLaMA-Omni 2 is built upon the Qwen2.5 series models, integrating a speech encoder and an autoregressive streaming speech decoder. Despite being trained on only 200K multi-turn speech dialogue samples, LLaMA-Omni 2 demonstrates strong performance on several spoken question answering and speech instruction following benchmarks, surpassing previous state-of-the-art SpeechLMs like GLM-4-Voice, which was trained on millions of hours of speech data.
#### fastabx: A library for efficient computation of ABX discriminability
 - **Authors:** Maxime Poli, Emmanuel Chemla, Emmanuel Dupoux
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
Computation and Language (cs.CL); Sound (cs.SD); Audio and Speech Processing (eess.AS)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02692

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.02692

 - **Abstract**
 We introduce fastabx, a high-performance Python library for building ABX discrimination tasks. ABX is a measure of the separation between generic categories of interest. It has been used extensively to evaluate phonetic discriminability in self-supervised speech representations. However, its broader adoption has been limited by the absence of adequate tools. fastabx addresses this gap by providing a framework capable of constructing any type of ABX task while delivering the efficiency necessary for rapid development cycles, both in task creation and in calculating distances between representations. We believe that fastabx will serve as a valuable resource for the broader representation learning community, enabling researchers to systematically investigate what information can be directly extracted from learned representations across several domains beyond speech processing.
