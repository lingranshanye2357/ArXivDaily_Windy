 - **Abstract**
 We present Kimi-Audio, an open-source audio foundation model that excels in audio understanding, generation, and conversation. We detail the practices in building Kimi-Audio, including model architecture, data curation, training recipe, inference deployment, and evaluation. Specifically, we leverage a 12.5Hz audio tokenizer, design a novel LLM-based architecture with continuous features as input and discrete tokens as output, and develop a chunk-wise streaming detokenizer based on flow matching. We curate a pre-training dataset that consists of more than 13 million hours of audio data covering a wide range of modalities including speech, sound, and music, and build a pipeline to construct high-quality and diverse post-training data. Initialized from a pre-trained LLM, Kimi-Audio is continual pre-trained on both audio and text data with several carefully designed tasks, and then fine-tuned to support a diverse of audio-related tasks. Extensive evaluation shows that Kimi-Audio achieves state-of-the-art performance on a range of audio benchmarks including speech recognition, audio understanding, audio question answering, and speech conversation. We release the codes, model checkpoints, as well as the evaluation toolkits in this https URL.

 - **Abstract**
 Speech production is a complex sequential process which involve the coordination of various articulatory features. Among them tongue being a highly versatile active articulator responsible for shaping airflow to produce targeted speech sounds that are intellectual, clear, and distinct. This paper presents a novel approach for predicting tongue and lip articulatory features involved in a given speech acoustics using a stacked Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) architecture, combined with a one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for post-processing with fixed weights initialization. The proposed network is trained with two datasets consisting of simultaneously recorded speech and Electromagnetic Articulography (EMA) datasets, each introducing variations in terms of geographical origin, linguistic characteristics, phonetic diversity, and recording equipment. The performance of the model is assessed in Speaker Dependent (SD), Speaker Independent (SI), corpus dependent (CD) and cross corpus (CC) modes. Experimental results indicate that the proposed model with fixed weights approach outperformed the adaptive weights initialization with in relatively minimal number of training epochs. These findings contribute to the development of robust and efficient models for articulatory feature prediction, paving the way for advancements in speech production research and applications.
